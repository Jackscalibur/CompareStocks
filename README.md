# CompareStocks

This was our 2021 UTD Hackathon Project. The goal was to get ourselves accustomed to how APIs work. To do this, we set out to create a web application that would display and compare different stock prices via graphs.

As of right now, the website is down. We haven't set up a paid API key yet, so please keep that in mind. The request limit has been reached for now.
